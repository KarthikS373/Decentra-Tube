# DecentraTube

DecentraTube, the future of video sharing and streaming. By leveraging the power of decentralized technologies, it offers increased security, censorship resistance, and copyright protection, as well as a fast and intuitive user experience

## Introduction

Decentratube is a revolutionary new platform that aims to disrupt the traditional model of video sharing and streaming. By utilizing the power of decentralized technologies such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Filecoin, DecentraTube allows users to upload and share videos without the need for a central server. This ensures that content is stored in a distributed manner, making it censorship-resistant and secure. Built with Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript, DecentraTube offers a fast, intuitive, and visually pleasing experience for users. No need to worry about buffering or downtime, as the decentralized nature of the platform ensures that videos are always accessible.

The main benefits of using a decentralized storage solution is the increased security and resistance to tampering. With traditional centralized platforms, content is stored on a single server, which is vulnerable to hacks and data breaches. In contrast, DecentraTube utilizes a distributed storage model, where content is spread across multiple nodes in a network. This makes it much harder for hackers to access and manipulate the data, as they would need to breach multiple nodes simultaneously. In addition to increased security, DecentraTube also offers censorship resistance. Centralized platforms are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, which can result in censorship of certain types of content. With a decentralized platform, there is no central authority that can censor content, making it a much more open and free platform for sharing and accessing videos. Another advantage is the protection of copyright. With traditional centralized platforms, it can be difficult for content creators to enforce their copyright and prevent unauthorized usage of their work. Decentralized storage solutions offer a way to ensure that content is protected and can only be accessed by those with the proper permissions.

## Technologies and Code Explanations

- Next JS
Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework that is used to build server-rendered React applications and allows to create web applications that are optimized for performance and scalability, and includes a number of built-in features such as automatic code splitting and optimized client-side rendering. Next.js is used to build the user interface and handle the rendering of pages on the server that allows a fast and seamless experience for users, as the server can handle the heavy lifting of rendering pages and serving content.

- Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is designed to make it easy to build user interfaces with consistent and customizable styles and allows for rapid development of visually pleasing user interfaces. Tailwind CSS is used to style the user interface and create a visually pleasing, consistent look and feel across the site and also to customize the branding and design of the platform.
